In CS - i) Searching
        ii) Sorting


Hashing >> 
i) Cryptography (unique fingerprint from a message >> message-digest)

ii) Hashing for efficient searching for data/record
    >> ideally we are looking for a constant time search >> O(1) [Big-Oh notation - asymptotic notation]

Computer Science

Program = Data Structures + Algorithms

Data Structures 
 >> How to store the data?  
 >> How efficient the access/retrieval of the data?

n number of records
Time O(n) (order of n - polynomial function of n with degree 1)

Time O(n^2) (order of n - polynomial function of n with degree 2)

Time O(2^n) (Exponential)

search_key = C10901298t8 (comparing search key with some id of the record)

C(mxp) = A(mxn) * B(nxp) (counting the number of scalar multiplication)

Primitive operation/Basic operation


---------------------------------------------

Principles of Cryptography:
i) Confidentiality >> crypto algorithms (AES)
ii) Authentication (proof of origin of the message)
    >> Digital Signature

iii) Message Integirty (the content of the message is unchaged) >> message digest >> summary of a message (fixed length fingerprint) >> 128 bit message digest  (unique)


Sender >> Receiver

 
Input (Data) >> Program (Algorithm) >> Output (Data)

In-class Assignments:
---------------------
Assignment-1: Image search application
A simple Python-based application for image search from an image database. (like Sequential search of image)

Input: 
> A directory containing a set of images.
> A search image (search key).

Output: 
List of all the images in that directory that match with the search key 

-------------------------------------------------------------

Assignment-2: Duplicate image search application
A simple Python-based application for duplicate image search from an image database. (Search for duplicate images in a given dataset).
Input: 
A directory containing a set of images.

Output: 
List of duplicate images in that directory

-------------------------------------------------------------

In computer science, a K-D tree (short for k-dimensional tree) is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space.
A K-D Tree is a Binary tree in which each node represents a k-dimensional point. 
Every non-leaf node in the tree acts as a hyperplane, dividing the space into two partitions. 
This hyperplane is perpendicular to the chosen axis, which is associated with one of the K dimensions.
