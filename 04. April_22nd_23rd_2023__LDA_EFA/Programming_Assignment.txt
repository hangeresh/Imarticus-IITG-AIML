Programming Assignment
------------------------
1. Generate data synthetically (n-dimensional)
2. Apply feature subset selection (k-dimensions)
 k < n
 
Part-1:
 > Apply feature subset selection algorithms (k-dimensions) 
   (Recursive Feature Elimination)
   (SelectKBest features)
 > Build a ML model with these k-features and test the accuracy

Part-2:
 > Dimensional reduction > k-dimension
  (PCA)
  (LDA)
 > Build a ML model with these k-features and test the accuracy


Compare the performance of Part-1 and Part-2.
